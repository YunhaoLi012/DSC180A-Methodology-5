For Quarter 2 project, we would like to investigate different methods people use with diffusion model to complete NLP tasks.
3. **What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
I would like to reconstruct the code already written and modularize them in my library.
4. **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
We would like to investigate using the techniques described in the control text diffusion where we add contraint to the structure of the sentences. We would like to see how can we include this function in our library.
